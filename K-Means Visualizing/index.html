	<h1>Learning K-Means</h1>
	<p>Clustering is grouping of data or dividing a large data set into smaller data sets of some similarity. A well known clustering algorithm in unsupervised machine learning is K-Means clustering. The K-Means algorithm takes in n observations (data points), and groups them into k clusters, where each observation belongs to a cluster based on the nearest mean (cluster centroid). The distance between a data point and cluster centroid is calculated using the Euclidean distance.</p>

	<h3>Five steps to do K-means</h3>
	<p>Step 1. Plot data points.</p>
	<p>Step 2. Initialize k additional points which are the seeds (cluster centroids) by plotting them randomly on the graph within the boundaries of the n observation’s dimenion ranges.</p>
	<p>Step 3. Assign each n data point to it’s closest cluster centroid (mean).</p>
	<p>Step 4. Move the cluster centroid to the average position of all the data points that belong to that mean.</p>
	<p>Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there is no change in each cluster centroid movement. If means remain the same (nothing moved) then we know the algorithm has finished.</p>

	<h3>Try the data viz down below to see how K-means works</h3>
	<p>Currently, the N=30, K=3: </p>
	<p>-  Click to set three K points in the viz below</p>
	<p>-  After setting K points, keep cicking to see how the groups and centers change over iterations</p>
	<p>-  Dots in the same color are in one group. The crossings represent the centers </p>
	<p>-  Try changing the K and N in the input field below the viz</p>

	<p>One disadvantage of K-means is its ability to handle the outliers. Try the data viz below to see the effect of clustering if there's an outlier</p>
